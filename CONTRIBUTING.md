# Contributing to olcPGEX_AdditionalColours

Contributions are the driving force behind this 'extension'. Pull requests are both welcome and encouraged!

## Guidelines / Code Style

- Each colour should be on its own line and defined in `ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE`
- When providing a colour, you should include dark and very dark variations to ensure consistency with the core PGE colours
- Colour names should be safe for work
